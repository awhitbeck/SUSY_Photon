This is work in progress. For the previous studies, this skimming was not done. Analysis code was run directly on RA2 trees.

Trigger objects are not saved in original RA2b trees. So these trees were remade. To reduce the size of the file, skimming was done soon after RA2b trees are made. So we have only skimmed trees with trigger objects saved in them.

The skimming code implemeted is here: https://github.com/vhegde91/SUSY_Photon/tree/master/MakeSkims/DMS_EleFakes/skimOnFly_RA2TreeProd
